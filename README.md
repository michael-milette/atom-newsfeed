## Apache SSI Example
    <!--#include virtual="/newsfeed.php?lang=en&max=50&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yoursite.ca%2Fyourfeed.atom.xml"-->

## Tips
  - If you see brackets around the date, the news feed can't be retrieved and is being delivered from an expired cache.
  - You can reset the cache in the URL by setting timeout=-1.
  - You can manually reset the cache by deleting all of the files called /tmp/newsfeed-* .
  - If it is not working for you, set $debug = true, reload your page with newsfeed.php?timeout=-1 in the URL and view source code to see additional info.
  
## Configuration
Look for the configuration section near the top of the newsfeed.php file. You will be able to configure the defaults for:
- $max - maximum number of entries to be displayed.
- desc - Enable/disable the description / summary.
- timeout - Default number of seconds for cache to live before it will be refreshed.
- lang - language. Currently supports English and French but can be easily expanded to include others.
- words - Maximum number of words (including HTML tags) to be displayed per entry.

Most of these can be overridden through optional parameters in the URL.

## Optional URL parameters 
(with default values)
  IMPORTANT: URL must be encoded in the next line:
  url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yoursite.com%2Fyourfeed.atom.xml   
  max=3       // Maximum number of entries to be displayed. 0 = All.
  desc=0      // 1 = Show, 0 = Hide description/summary.
  timeout=600 // Default number of seconds for cache to live (600 = 10 minutes, 0 = no cache, -1 = purge cache).
  lang=en     // Default language for error messages - fr or en (default).
  words=0     // Maximum number of (HTML) words to be displayed per entry (0 = unlimited).

### DEBUG Instructions
